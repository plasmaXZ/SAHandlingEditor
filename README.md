# SAHandlingEditor
This is an old project thas I was working on. It's currently discontinued since this type of handling editor is not really useful anymore for GTA SA. I decided to make it open source anyway so that people maybe find one or two useful thing in the code that can be reused somewhere else.

For now, it's a really simple console application that can read a handling.cfg file. The default path for the file is the project's root folder, but that can be changed rather easily.
